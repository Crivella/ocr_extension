# Change Log

List of changes between versions

## 0.3.2

- Fixed an issue with websites that impose a `text-indent` on the image original class (inherited by the wrapper div and thus the wrapped text)
  EG: some sites use a `.preload` class on the image which has a `text-indent: -9999px` style causing the text to render out of the visible area
  Forcing tha `patch-text` to have a `text-indent: 0` style fixes this issue and should have no side effects on other elements iun the page
